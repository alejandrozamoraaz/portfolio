      "title": "Prototype of Clinical Records Manager",
      "description": "<p>Medical records system designed in Adobe XD, intended for three types of users: the patient, who will have access to the visualization of their medical history using their ID, the doctor who will input the information, and an administrator who manages one or several clinics.</p> <br/> <p>All users have the ability to view their statistics. The doctor will have templates for different types of consultations and can search for the patient, but to streamline the process, it is recommended that the patient shares their generated QR code with the doctor. Every step or change in the patient's status will be saved for future viewing.</p> <br/> <p>At the system level, it is designed as an interconnected one, where each center, institution, or clinic manages its own assets such as doctors or patients, but shares information among them under appropriate standards and security. This is to provide a better experience and monitoring of patients' records.</p>"
